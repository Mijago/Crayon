# TLDR;

1. Invite the bot to your server with [this link](http://bot.d2armorpicker.com). Make sure that Crayon has the listed permissions.  
2. Make sure that the role `Everyone` has the permission `Use External Emotes` in the Channel you want to use Crayon.

# Adding Crayon to your server
To add Crayon to your server, an administrator of your discord server has to use [this link](http://bot.d2armorpicker.com).
Accept the given permissions, as they are required.

Crayon adds the existing commands as Slash-commands, which means you can use them in any channel.
You can remove the permission to use Slash-Commands from individual channels. 

Due to an issue with Discord Interactions, the role `Everyone` needs the permission to `Use External Emotes`.
Otherwise, Crayon will not be able to display perk emotes.
