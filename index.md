## Welcome to Crayon by Mijago
Crayon is a simple bot, allowing you to search for Destiny 2 items and triumphs right in Discord.
It is intended to be a companion to Charlemagne, not a competitor. 

Built for you by Mijago, the developer behind [D2ArmorPicker](https://d2armorpicker.com).

## Functionality
Crayon adds the following slash commands:
- `/item [name]` - Let's you search for items
- `/triumph [name]` - Let's you search for triumphs
- `/guardian [name#1234]` - Let's you search for guardians
- `/rotation [type]`  - Shows you rotations for Nightfalls, Raid Challenges, and the rotating things on Europa and in the Dreaming City.

Both the `/item` and the `/triumph` command allow you to have typos in your text. If you type `/item reds regrt` it will correctly find `Reed's Regret`.

## Item-Search
By using `/item [NAME]` you can easily search for any item you want.
Crayon recognizes any Destiny 2 item and shows you it's description, perks and other valuable information.
For cosmetics it will automatically display a large preview.

## Guardian-Search
With `/guardian [NAME#1234]` you can easily lookup the stats of guardians. It gives you many useful links, specifically for this user!

Also, in case it can not find the user, it will give you a handsome dropdown menu:

## Rotation-Commands
These are self explanatory. Most of them are already in Charlemagne, but hey, why not. **Note that I have to add these manually and that some will be invalid at the change of a season!**
