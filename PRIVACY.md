# Privacy Policy
Crayon does not collect any type of information, except in the case of internal errors. 
Every text you send to Crayon via the slash commands is used for the search command and not saved in any kind of database.

An exception of this happens when an internal error happens. 
Crayon will log the text given to it, but not who sent it.
