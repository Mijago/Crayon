- Crayon does not receive any messages besides its own slash commands.
- Crayon may occasionally log the usage of an command in a debugging-log-channel. This happens for example after an update to see how a new command performs and if results are displayed correctly.
- If an internal error occurs, Crayon will log the text given to it, but not who sent it.
